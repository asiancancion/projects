- CS210 FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL, Fall 2022
===========================================================================
- Memory Game
- Name: Caleb Song
- Section: T6/7
- Documentation Statement: None
===========================================================================

OVERVIEW: Memory Game
This is where you will write a brief description of your project.  You do not need to write a lot, but you do need to provide enough detail for your instructor to get a good understanding of what you would like to do.

This Project will be a memory game where the user will be presented with "cards" represented by characters. The cards will be hidden and the user will choose 2 cards revealing them. If they match they will stay revealed,
if they do not match they will be revealed until the user's next move until the user has matched all the cards. The user will define how many "cards" they want in the game. The game will allow for multiple players and Will
determine the winner based on who made the least "moves" or card reveals to reveal all the cards.

INTERFACE MECHANISM:
How will users interact with your program?  Is it with Curses, command line, etc?
Terminal Text-based Interface
===========================================================================
Required Programming Skills (must have 5 of 6):
   -- Leave blank if you aren't planning on implementing.
   1) Dynamic Memory Allocation
	How are you going to meet this req: User will decide how large the array of cards will be

   2) Pointers
	How are you going to meet this req: Use dynamic array

   3) File I/O
	How are you going to meet this req: Will print answer key to an output file

   4) Structs
	How are you going to meet this req: Struct of user information - name, score, etc.

   5) String Manipulation
	How are you going to meet this req: board is an array of chars so it is a string

   6) Processing of Array Data
	How are you going to meet this req: Will process array data by using user provided card choices and comparing. Will also run through array and randomly assign chars to the "cards" or indices of the array.

Required Advanced Programming Skills (1 of the below):
   -- Leave blank if you aren't planning on implementing.
   1) Recursion
	How are you going to meet this req:

   2) 2D Dynamic Memory
	How are you going to meet this req: 2D display of cards the dimensions are decided by the user and created with dynamic memory
