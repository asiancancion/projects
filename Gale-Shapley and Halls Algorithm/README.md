# Gale-Shapley and Halls Algorithm
Using csv files of pairings and priorities tests to see if there are rogue pairs (if a "boy" likes a "girl" he is not paired to more than his current matching and that "girl" also likes the "boy" more than her current matching)

Gale-Shapley pairs priorities in boy-favored and girl-favored scenarios

Halls finds a pairing so that every boy is matched to a girl but does not regard rogue pairingss
