# HW 1

## Project Overview
This program implements solutions to three algorithmic problems:
1. **Finding the Minimum and Maximum Values in an Array** with at most `1.5n` comparisons.
2. **Determining if a Set of Vertices Forms a Clique** in an undirected graph represented by an adjacency matrix.
3. **Sorting an Array in Î˜(n) Time** for distinct integers in the range `[1, kn]`.
